Compare politicians in a side by side contest where Google's search statistics show who is more popular. Not many people know that Google tracks what people are searching for and the volume of those searches. 
It is easy to compare politicians in a visual way with this graph generator and see who is more popular without resorting to votes. 
You will be pretty shocked at who is more popular then who, besides being thoroughly entertained. 
This tool will be something your political audience will appreciate using and playing around with.
